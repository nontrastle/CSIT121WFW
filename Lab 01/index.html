<h3>Begin</h3>
<p>Time to combine the ingridents.</p>
<dl>
	<dt><b>Combine Dry Ingredients</b></dt>
		<dd>In the bowl with the ground turkey combine the diced green pepers, bread crumbs, onion and the seasoning. Season to taste. Let your heart lead you!</dd>
	<dt><b>Add Wet Ingredients</b></dt>
		<dd>Next crack the egg into the bowl with the ground turkey. Carefull not to get any shells. No one wants a crunchy burger.Then add the milk. </dd>
	<dt><b>Mix it All Around</b></dt>
		<dd>It is time to get messy! Take your hands and mix everything together until the seasonings, bread crumbs, peper and onions are all evenly distributed throughout the ground turkey. If the mixture is too dry then add a little more milk.
		</dd>
	<dt><b>Shape Your Burgers</b></dt>
		<dd>Once the ingredients have been fully mixed take a portion and begin to shape your burgers to your liking. No one will judge you if your patty is inches thick! Once the burgers are shaped set aside on a plate.</dd>
	<dt><b>Turn up the Heat</b></dt>
		<dd>Turn up the heat on your skillet to medium high. You want the pan hot but not burning the oil. Once the pan is hot lay that first burger down and watch the magic begin. Once the edges of the burger begin to crisp up and turn brown flip it over to let it finish cooking. Depending on how thick your burger is it ususally takes about 5min on each side.</dd>
	<dt><b>Dress and Serve</b></dt>
		<dd>Once you have all your burgers cooked set them a top of a paper towel and pat down to get rid of excessive oil. Take the remaing half of your onion, chop up and add to the same pan that the burgers came out of. You may need to add a little more oil to fry the onions. Once the onions are fried place atop of burgers with any other fixings of your choice. Toast burger buns or bread if you don't have buns and place burger on top and enjoy!</dd>
